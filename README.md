Sentiment analysis of code-mixed languages from SentiMix 2020

## Final project for CSCI 5832
Here, we evaluate and build on the results from the winner of the [SemEval-2020 Task 9 2020](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.03673.pdf) of the SentiMix competition for sentiment analysis for hindi-english tweets. We reproduce the same methods to attempt to arrive at similar results when analyzeing hindi-english as well as apply the same method to analyzing dravidian code mixed language. We then perform error analysis to determine the underlying reasons for differences in performance accross language types.
